## Introduction to SCADA System
a power plant operator uses a SCADA system for safe operation. the system continuously monitors the temperature of the air inside the chamber and the speed of the rotating turbine. if the speed of the turbine or temperature in the combustion chamber reaches a value outside the safe operating range, then it shuts down the unit. note that a power plant, like most industrial units, cannot be abruptly shut-down. it must undergo a controlled shut down which is done by this system.
